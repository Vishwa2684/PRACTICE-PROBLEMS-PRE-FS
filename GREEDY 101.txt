To maximize energy efficiency and lighting optimization, you are allowed to perform 
an operation multiple times:
	You can choose any row or column of the grid and toggle all the bulbs in 
	that row or column. Toggling means:
		- Bulbs that are ON (1) will turn OFF (0).
		- Bulbs that are OFF (0) will turn ON (1).

Each row in the grid can be interpreted as a binary number, where the leftmost bulb 
is the most significant bit and the rightmost bulb is the least significant bit. 
The goal is to maximize the sum of these binary numbers for all rows in the grid, 
after performing any number of toggles on the grid.

Your task is to find the highest possible score, which is the maximum sum of all 
the binary numbers that can be obtained after optimizing the grid through these 
toggling operations.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two space separated integers, M and N
Next M lines: N space separated integers, grid[][]

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer result.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
3 5
0 1 1 1 1 
1 0 1 1 1 
0 0 0 0 1 

Sample Output-1:
----------------
78

Explanation:
------------
Given grid is 
0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Perform operation on row-0 and row-2
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0

Perform operation on col-1 and col-4
1 1 0 0 1 = 25
1 1 1 1 0 = 30
1 0 1 1 1 = 23
So, now the total value of Binary Equivalent is 78


Sample Input-2:
---------------
2 3
0 1 0
0 0 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
11

You are a warehouse manager responsible for distributing packages across different 
storage bins to minimize the maximum load in any single bin. You are given an 
integer array packages[] where the ith element represents the number of items in 
the ith package. Additionally, you are given an integer maxSplits, which defines
the maximum number of times you are allowed to split a package.

A single split operation allows you to divide a package into two smaller packages, 
each containing a positive number of items. For example, a package with 10 items 
can be split into two new packages with sizes 6 and 4, or 3 and 7.

Your objective is to minimize the "MaxLoad", defined as the maximum number of 
items in any package, after performing at most maxSplits operations.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two space separated integers, N and P
Line-2: N space separated integers, packages[].

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer result, MaxLoad.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
1 3
15

Sample Output-1:
----------------
4

Explanation:
------------
Split the package with 15 items into packages of sizes 7 and 8. 
    [15] -> [7,8].
Split the package with 8 items into packages of sizes 4 and 4. 
    [7,8] -> [7,4,4].
Split the package with 7 items into packages of sizes 4 and 3. 
    [7,4,4] -> [4,4,4,3].
After these operations, the package with the highest load has 4 items, 
    so the MaxLoad is 4.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
3 4
6 15 24

Sample Output-2:
----------------
3

Explanation:
------------
Split the package with 24 items into packages of sizes 8 and 16. 
    [6,15,24] -> [6,15,8,16].
Split the package with 16 items into packages of sizes 8 and 8. 
    [6,15,8,16] -> [6,15,8,8,8]
Split one of the packages with 15 items into packages of sizes 7 and 8. 
    [6,15,8,8,8] -> [6,7,8,8,8,8]
Split the remaining package with 8 items into packages of sizes 4 and 4. 
    [6,7,8,8,8,8] -> [6,7,4,4,8,8,8]
After these operations, the package with the highest load has 8 items, 
    So the MaxLoad is 8.
